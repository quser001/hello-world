# hello-world

Hello Everyone,
  Never used GitHub before, glad to start the first step.  I am branching to Python from SAP.  Python is simple and easy to understand as of now, getting my feet wet.  Hopefully in couple of weeks I should be able to get a better handle of Python to accomplish what I want (Webapps, Data Analytics, etc)
